# weather-app

Simple weather provider app for learning purposes. The final project for the Accelerated JS Training course on Udemy.

## Description

It's just a simple weather provider app. Insert a city name and get the current weather info and temperature.
Made with JS, HTML and CSS using just the basics, DOM manipulation and HTTP Request for the weather API.

## Getting Started

To test the app and see it working, you want to clone the repo and execute the HTML file like any other simple website.
For security reasons, you'll have to get your own free API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) site and edit 'app.js' file.

Change ```const key = 'api key here'``` for your key and run the app.
